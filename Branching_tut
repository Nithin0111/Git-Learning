Branching is nothing but creating a copy of all the files so tht we can work 
on them for eg:we have two files in our master branch very important files
but you want to add something else to them but you have a fear that if i do 
anything wrong these files will be crashed and my work will be destroyed
to avoid this situation branching helps what you do is create an another branch
named security what this will do is copy all the files from master branch to
security branch and you can work on whatever you like in the security branch you
have no fear of losing the files because the original files are still in the 
master branch untouched you are changing the content in another branch this will
not effect the master branch files so you have worked more on this security
branch and you have shown it to your manager and your manager tests them and 
says they are good so after all the testing is done if it works you can 
merge the security branch with the master branch let's see how to create 
a branch and how to merge with the master branch first in terminal 
type command (git branch) you can see all the branches and you can see
green colour for particular branch that means you are working in that branch
to create a branch type command (git branch branch-name) here (git branch security)
to change branch from master to security so that a copy of all files in master 
branch will be there in sec branch also type command (git checkout branch-name)
here (git checkout security) and when u execute this command it says 
switched to branch security now you can do ay changes in this branch these
changes will not effect master branch suppose we added another file and you have
staged them by using git add . and you committed them by using git commit -m "added security file"
now to push these files use command (git push origin security) notice change
here we are saying origin security files will be pushed to security branch
now to merge this into the master branch use command first 
switch to master branch using command (git checkout master) now master
branch will be selected and now use this command  (git merge security) so all files will be merged to master branch now all you have to is push these merged files to master branch 
to do tht use this  command (git push -u origin master) now all merged files 
from security which are stored locally will be pushed to github master branch
 we r using -u in git push -u origin master because
if we write this command now is there is no need to write the whole line if
u just use git push only it will push to master branch that is the use of -u
