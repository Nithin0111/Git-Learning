here in allinfoaboutgit we are doing all the commits and all adds in the 
local git repository but if we want to add all the changes and commits from
local git repository to the github repository if for the first time you are
pushing the code from your local computer to github first you need to 
generate your your ssh key so that gihub knows that the commits done are
from your computer only so to generate ssh keys follow these commands open
github settings and you can find ssh and gpg keys now goto there if there is
an ssh key you no need to generate if you are not sure for which computer it
is linked then you can delete the key and down only you can find guide to
generating a new sshkey you can see that you will understand completely and 
to push your code command is (git push -u origin master) and all your commited
code is pushed to github if there is not any committed code it will not be 
pushed to github if any one made changes to the repository you will not be shown 
when you type (git log) you have to pull the code from github by typing 
(git pull origin master) when this command is executed then you will be shown
all the changes made by other or by you in the github website now if you type
(git log) then all the changes are shown
