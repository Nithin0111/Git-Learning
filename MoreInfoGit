In this we learn how to see what changes we have made in our files and how 
to undo these changes and how to go back to previous commit first lets assume
that we have changed something in one of our files and we forgot what changes
we have made so you can see the changes you have made after the previous commit
by using a command called (git diff) if you want to see the changes in the 
specified file then you have to use command (git diff filename) and it will
show the changes in that particular file and you have staged a file to see
the differences in the staged area git diff will not show you have to use 
command git diff --staged filename to see the changes in the staged area let's assume
that your manager has seen your staged files and said that you have done wrong
code and said to make as it was previously so you haver to first unstage files
that you have staged by using git add to unstage use command
 (git reset filename) and the files will be unstaged and to go back to previous
commit we use git checkout filename to undo the changes in all the files you
use command (git checkout .) so it will undo all the changes made before 
but you can only undo these changes before commit only even you staged the file
you can unstage by using (git reset filename) for specific file and (git reset .)
for all files and you can use (git checkout filename) for specific file and
 (git checkout .) for all files to undo the changes but if you commit you cannot
undo the changes so commit when you are absolutely sure
