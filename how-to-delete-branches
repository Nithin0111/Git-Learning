in this file we will see how to delete branches once we merged with the master
branch beacuse there is wastage of memory to keep these branches because 
their use is over so to delete branch you have to delete two times one locally
and one on remote github to delete locally use command
(git branch -d branch-name) here git branch -d security now after we do that
the branch will be deleted locally you can check by command (git branch) it
will show only one branch only that is master so now deleting remotely on
github use command (git push origin --delete branch-name) here
git push origin --delete security after executing the branch will be deleted
