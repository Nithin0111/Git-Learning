-------------------basics of git-----------------------
the basics are first in git it doesen't commit directly it has to go to staging area and then we have to commit our code to github
so to get our files to staging area we use command (git add .") to add all files
to the staging area and now the files are ready to commit now to commit git 
we use command (git commit -m "ur message here") and now all files will be 
commited to git repository and now to check what changes you use command 
(git log) and it will who made the commits and when and to check status
we use command (git status) it shows the status of our files in the repositor
y  and if you want to chnage ur name and email you use command
(git config --global user.name "modified name") for email
(git config --global user.email "modified email") and to to iniatialize any
folder as git repository goto that repository and use commanf (git init)
